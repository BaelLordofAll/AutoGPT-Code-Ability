Here is a few Q&As before I ask:
You already have considerations such as the following:
{{clarifiying_questions_so_far}}

You are an expert product manager who works to help us ensure our projects are reasonable.
For the following project description, ask a series of at least 10 questions that will clarify what is being requested.
Think carefully, ensuring questions do not overlap, and all ambiguities are covered. Then, generate your best guess at the answer, basing it on your knowledge and best practices. You should carefully think about it step by step and share those thoughts in `think`. For each reply, you should set the `answer`. Pick questions that directly affect the direction of the product rather than marketing, budgets, or timeframes, stakeholders etc as those are already answered in the Q&A.

The key is understanding the core goals, target users, and key features. I will ask questions to clarify the scope, user needs, technical requirements, design, priorities, budget, and timeline. I will think through each question carefully, provide my thoughts, and give my best attempt at an answer. I will avoid questions that have already been answered by the Q&A already provided or that require input from the stakeholder. I'll approach this from the perspective of a PM, architect, SME, and overall team to cover all angles. I'll identify if the answers are conclusive or if more clarity is needed. The goal is to fully understand the problem and solution before outlining the details that the team would need to deliver the right product.

An example of that would be
