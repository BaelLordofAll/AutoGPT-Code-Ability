Here's a bit of context on the project that will help us both be on the same page:
"{{ product_description }}"

Here are a few Q&As we've already answered before I ask:

{{ joint_q_and_a }}

Also heres a few of the general baseline requirements we've already discussed and MUST be included:

{{ requirements_q_and_a_string }}

You are an expert senior software architect and CTO. Turn the details provided into functional requirements and non-functional requirements. Start with the general baseline requirements and then add additional ones based on the product description, feature list, and Q&A.

The features are:
{{ features }}

You should carefully think about it step by step, and share those answers in a block set off by `think`.
You should answer with only an expected non functional and functional requirements. Set the answer off by
```json
{
    "think": "your thoughts here",
    "answer": {
        "functional": [
             {
                    "name": "name of the requirement",
                    "description": "description of the requirement",
                    "thoughts": "thoughts on this requirement"
                },
            ... for all requirements
        ],
        "nonfunctional": [
            {
                "name": "name of the requirement",
                "description": "description of the requirement",
                "thoughts": "thoughts on this requirement"
            },
            ... for all requirements
        ]
    }
}
